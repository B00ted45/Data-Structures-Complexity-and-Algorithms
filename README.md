## Matrices and list comprehension
___

matrixs are a list within a list

##### rules
- All rows must have the same number of values
- All columns must have the same number of values
- All items in the 2D List must have the same data types
- Since indexing always starts at 0 ... row 1 is technically located at matrix_A[0]


#### List comprehenstion rules
* A Square Bracket containing an expression that describes the list
* One or more For clause to explain its members
* Then a zero or more if clauses depending on the complexity of the list
